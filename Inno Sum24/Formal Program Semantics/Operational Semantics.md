## Definition
- Operational semantics translates programs to corresponding state machines (“mechanical procedures” of a certain class) whose “operations” (that change machine’s state) are (conventionally) “executable”: semantics of a program is defined in terms and by means of all admissible “executions” (i.e., runs) of the corresponding machine.
