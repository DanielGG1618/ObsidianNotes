## Definition
- [[Map]] between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as [[Group]]s, [[Ring]]s, [[Fields]]...), that preserves the [[Operation]](s) of the structures and all required restrictions.
- Let $f: A\to B$ be a Homomorphism and $A, B$ be two [[Set]]s equipped with [[Operation]]s $\cdot$ and $\circ$ respectively, then $$\forall x,y\in A:f(x\cdot y)=f(x)\circ f(y)$$
