## Theorem
- For any finite [[Group]] $G$ the order (number of elements) of every [[Subgroup]] of $G$ is a divisor for the order of $G$.
## Proof
- The left cosets of $H$ in $G$ are the [[Equivalence Class]]es of a certain [[Equivalence Relation]] on $G$: specifically, call $x$ and $y$ in $G$ equivalent if $\exists h\in H: x=yh$
- Therefore, the left costs from a partition of $G$. Each left coset $gH$ has the same cardinality as $H$ because $x\mapsto g$ defines a [[Bijection]] $H\to gH$ (the [[Inverse Element]] is $y\mapsto g^{-1}y$). The number of left cosets in the index $[G:H]$
- Therefore, $$|G|=[G:H]\cdot |H|$$
