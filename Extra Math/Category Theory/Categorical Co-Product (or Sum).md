## Definition
- *Co-Product* is just a [[Categorical Product]] in [[Opposite Category]], hah, quite obvious, but
-  For given objects $a$ and $b$ in some [[Category]] $C$ product is a triple $(c, i, j)$ where $c$ is an object in the same [[Category]] and $i, j$ are [[Morphism]]s $a\to c, b\to c$ respectively with the following property:
$$\forall c'\in C, i'\in C(a,c'), ij\in C(a,c')\,\exists! m\in C(c,c'): i'=m\circ i \;\&\;j'=m\circ j$$
