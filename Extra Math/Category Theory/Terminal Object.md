## Definition
- Object $t$ in [[Category]] is *Terminal* if: $$\forall a\,\exists! m:a\to t$$
## Examples
- Singleton Object in [[Category SET]]
## Notes
- If there exists some complex path from $a$ to Terminal Object, then there is a direct [[Morphism]] from $a$ to the Terminal Object. But we also know that [[Morphism]] from $a$ to the Terminal Object is unique, which means that any complex path is the same [[Morphism]]
- For given [[Category]] all *Terminal Objects* are [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]]
