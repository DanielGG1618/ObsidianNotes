### Typically memory is divided on 3 parts:
- #### Program 
	Static memory where program is stored. Program cannot modify this memory: self-modified programs are not allowed
- #### Heap
	Dynamic memory. The discipline of using heap is defined by program dynamic semantics, i.e., at runtime (while program execution)
- #### Stack
	Local objects are stored. The discipline of using stack is defined by the (static) program structure
