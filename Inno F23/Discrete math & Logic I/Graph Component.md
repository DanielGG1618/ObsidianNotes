## Definition 
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a [[Graph]]. A maximal [[Graph Connectivity|connected]] [[Subgraph]] of $G$ is called a *component* of $G$

$G'=(V',E')$ if a *subgraph* of $G$, if $V'\subseteq V\;\&\;E'\subseteq E$
## Proposition
Any [[Graph]] is a disjoint [[Union]] of all its connected components.
