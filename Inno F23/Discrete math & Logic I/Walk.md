## Definition
The [[Sequence]] $u_1u_2 ...u_k$ is called a *walk* or a *way* from $u_1$ to $u_k,$ if $\forall u_1,u_{i+1}$ are neighbors
## Definitions 
Let the [[Sequence]] $u_1u_2 ...u_k$ be a *walk*.
- It is *closed* if $u_1=u_k$
- It is a *path* if $\forall i\not = j\: (u_i,u_{i+1})\not=(u_j,u_{j+1})$
- It is a *cycle* if it is a closed path
