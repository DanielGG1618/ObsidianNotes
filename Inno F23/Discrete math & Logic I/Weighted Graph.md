## Definition
- A [[Graph]] is called *weighted* if each vertex or edge has an associated numerical value, i.e.
	- a vertex-weighted graph has weights on its vertices
	- an edge-weighted graph has weights on its edges
## Formal Definition
A [[Graph]] $G=(V,E)$ is vertex-weighted:
$$\exists f:V\to\mathbb R$$
A [[Graph]] $G=(V,E)$ is edge-weighted:
$$\exists f:E\to\mathbb R$$
## Total Weight
- Is the sum of the weights of its edges.
