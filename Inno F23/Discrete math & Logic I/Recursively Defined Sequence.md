## Definition 
- Say that the $n$-th element of the [[Sequence]] $\{a_n\}$ is defined recursively in terms of the previous elements of the sequence and the initial elements of the sequence.
## Example
- Recursively: $a_0 = 1, a_{n+1} = a_n+2$
- Non-recursively: $a_n = 1 + 2n$
- List: $1, 3, 5, 7,...$
