## Definition
The set of planes through a given straight line in three-space, called the axis of the pencil
## The way it works
So, for [[Plane|planes]] let's say $P_1, P_2$ with general form obvious what we have their normal vectors as $\left(\begin{matrix}A_1\\ B_1\\ C_1\end{matrix}\right), \left(\begin{matrix}A_2\\ B_2\\ C_2\end{matrix}\right)$ respectively. And, what we have now is the normal of any plane that can be derived with the equation on the top is $\left(\begin{matrix}A_1+\lambda A_2\\ B_1+\lambda B_2\\ C_1+\lambda C_2\end{matrix}\right)$, which is obviously linearly dependent to the normal vectors of $P_1, P_2$ which means that they are coplanar.
