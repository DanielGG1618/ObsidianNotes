## Definition
In mathematics a **homogeneous function** is a function of several variables such that, if all its arguments are multiplied by a scalar, then its value is multiplied by some power of this scalar, called the **degree of homogeneity**, or simply the _degree_; that is, if $k$ is an integer, a function $f$ of $n$ variables is homogeneous of degree $k$ if
- ${\displaystyle f(sx_{1},\ldots ,sx_{n})=s^{k}f(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})}$
- for every $x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}$ and $\displaystyle s\neq 0.$
