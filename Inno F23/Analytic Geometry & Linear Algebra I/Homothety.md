## Definition
- **A homothety** (or homothecy, or homogeneous dilation) is a transformation of an affine space determined by a point $S$ called its center and a nonzero number $k$ called its ratio, which sends point $X$ to a point $X^\prime$ by the rule
	- $\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {SX'}}=k{\overrightarrow {SX}}$ for a fixed number ${\displaystyle k\neq 0}$.
Using position vectors:
$\displaystyle \mathbf {x} '=\mathbf {s} +k(\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {s} )$.
In case of ${\displaystyle S=O} (Origin):$
${\displaystyle \mathbf {x} '=k\mathbf {x} }$
## Properties
1. $A(\overline r_1, \overline r_2) = A(\overline r_1)+A(\overline r_2)$
2. $A(\lambda\overline r)=\lambda A(\overline r)$
Therefore, [[Homothety]] is linear by the theorem of [[Linearity]]
