## Definition
- Numbers with a finite number of digits
- Some properties are lost: 
- Operators closure 
- Distributive and associative properties 
- Holes in the representation of real numbers
## Example
- Integer numbers with 2 decimal digits
	- Interval: $[0; 99]$
	- Lost closure with respect to operator $+$
		- $76 + 30 = ??? (106\not\in[0;99])$
	- Lost [[Associativity]]:
		- $25+(90-30)\not=(25+90)-30$
