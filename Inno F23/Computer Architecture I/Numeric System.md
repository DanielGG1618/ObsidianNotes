## Definition
- A set of values used to represent different quantities
- To define a Numeric System we need: 
	- A set of symbols that we will call digits (E.g. 1,2,3, A,C, . . . .) 
	- Some rules to build up numbers
## Types
### Positional
- digit value depends on its position within the number (weight) 
	- Each digit represents the coefficient of a power of the base
	- Exponent is given by the position of the digit within the number
### Non Positional
- the value of digits in the number is position independent
