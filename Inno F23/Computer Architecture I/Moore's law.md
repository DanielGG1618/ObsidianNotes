## Definition
- The number of transistors on a CPU chip doubles every 18-24 months (leads to an increased CPU speed) 
- This observation is useful for long term projects: By project completion time, CPU speed might increase significantly![[Pasted image 20231004140920.png]]
### Note
- There is an ongoing discussion, if Mooreâ€™s law still holds
## Stagnation
- Key reason $\to$ Hear dissipation problem
- Another reason $\to$ The limitation of the speed of light
