## Volatile and Non-Volatile
- Volatile memory is a type of memory that maintains its data only while the device is powered (e.g. processor cache, [[Main Memory]])
- Non-Volatile memory is a type of memory that maintains its data without depending on power.
## Primary and Secondary
- Primary - typically [[Main Memory]], [[CPU Cache]] and [[ROM]] for BIOS are assumed
- Secondary - memory units at a lower level of memory hierarchy (SSD, HDD, etc.)
## [[RAM]], [[SAM]], [[ROM]]
## Locality Principles
- Temporal locality - tendency to reuse recently accessed date items
- Spatial locality - tendency to reuse data items located at neighboring addresses in [[Main Memory]]
## Memory Types
#### [[RAM|SRAM]] 
(e.g. [[CPU Cache]])
#### [[RAM|DRAM]] 
(e.g. [[Main Memory]])
#### [[ROM]]
(e.g. BIOS)
#### Flash
(e.g.  SSD)
#### Magnetic Disks
(HDD)
