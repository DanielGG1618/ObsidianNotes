### 7. Dependability (reliability) via redundancy
- Some redundant (or “spare”) components are introduced (e.g. CPU or memory unit), to increase the reliability of a computer platform (e.g. in a spacecraft );
### 8. Make the common case faster
- The computer platform should be optimized for the most common use case expected
### 9. [[Finite State Machine]]
