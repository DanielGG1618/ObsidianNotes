## Terminology
- A *Boolean function* - a function taking one or multiple binary inputs and producing exactly one binary output
- A *Truth table* - A table specifying the output of a Boolean function for every combination of input values
- A *Logic gate* - An abstract of physical device implementing a Boolean function
- A *Logic circuit* - A composition of logic gates, to implement a certain a Boolean function
- An *Integrated Circuit* - The antonym for “discrete electrical circuit”, that is a set of discrete electrical devices, which can be assembled and reassembled again
	- Key advantages of “integrated” over “discrete” circuits: 
		- Compact size; 
		- Performance (e.g. the [[Propagation delay]]); 
		- Lower manufacturing price
- [[Transistor]]
- [[Universal Logic Circuits]]
## Properties
- Combines input signals and outputs the result
- Uses logic gates, such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, etc.
- Does not use memory elements (registers)
- Does not use clock signal (typically)
## Usage
- Implementation of arithmetic operations
