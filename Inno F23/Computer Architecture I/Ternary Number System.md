- The ternary (or trinary) numeral system also called base-3
- Analogous to a bit (binary digit), a trit is a ternary digit (trinary digit, ”trinary” is the synonym for ”ternary”) 
- Variations of ternary systems: 
	- Standard (unbalanced) system: uses values 0, 1, 2 
	- Balanced system: uses values -1, 0, 1 
	- Unknown state logic: False, ?, True (analogous to Fuzzi Logic) 
- One trit is equivalent to $log_23$ (about 1.58496) bits of information 
- An advantage is lower number of trits to represent large values
