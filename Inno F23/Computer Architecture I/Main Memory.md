## Definition
- Data at different memory addresses is accessed directly (not sequentially), or “randomly”, yielding term “RAM”: random access memory
- Provides a faster data access than SSD or HDD, but slower than CPU registers or caches 
- Volatile memory type: data is lost, if power supply is off (unlike SSD or HDD disk)
