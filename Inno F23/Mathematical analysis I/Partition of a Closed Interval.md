## Definition
- A partition of a real interval $[a,b]$ is anu finite [[Sequence]] of reals $(x_k)_{k\in[0..n]}$ such that $a=x_0<x_1<x_2<...<x_k...<x_n=b$
- Each $[x_k,x_{k+1}]$ is called a sub-interval of the partition $(x_k)_{k\in[0..n]}$
- The mesh (or norm) of the partition is the length of the longest sub-interval: 
$$\max_{k\in[0..n[}(x_{k+1}-x_k)$$
