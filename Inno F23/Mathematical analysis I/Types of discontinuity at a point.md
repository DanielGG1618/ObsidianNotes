#### Let $f: D\to\mathbb R$ be a function and $b\in D$ be a real point
## type-I
the left and the right [[Limit from Side|limits]] exist, are real, but not equal
$\displaystyle\delta = \lim_{x\to d+0}f(x)-\lim_{x\to d-0}f(x)$ is called the **jump** of $f$ at point $d$
## type-II
function is not [[Continuity|continuous]] at $d$, but the point is not type-I
