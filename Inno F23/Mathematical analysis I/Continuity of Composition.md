## Statement
- Let $f: D\to E\subseteq \mathbb R, g: E\to\mathbb R$ be any real functions and $d\in D$ be a point. 
- $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]] at $d$ and $g$ is [[Continuity|continuous]] at $f(d)\implies$
	- $h=g\circ f=\lambda x\in D.g(f(x))$ is continuous at $d$
## Proof
- Immediately follows from [[Function Composition]]
