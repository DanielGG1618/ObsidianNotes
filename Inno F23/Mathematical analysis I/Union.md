## Axiom
For any set of $A$ the union ($\cup_{B \in A} B$) is a set which consists of all "elements of elements" in $A$: $C \in  (\cup_{B \in A})$ if $C \in B$ for some $B \in A$.
### Prove that union of any two sets is a set
if $X$ and $Y$ are sets then $Z = X \cup Y = \{w\,|\,w \in X$ or $z \in Y\}$
Let $A = \{X, Y\}$, $\cup_{B\in A} =  \{c\,|\, c \in X$ or $c \in Y\} = Z$ by predication. $\iff A = Z \iff Z$ is a set. Q.E.D. $\blacksquare$
