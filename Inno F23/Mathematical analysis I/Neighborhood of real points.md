## Definition
- A neighborhood of $x\in\mathbb R$ is any set $V\subseteq\mathbb R: \exists v\in\mathbb R, v>0: \;]x-v,x+v[\;\subseteq V$
## Examples
- $\mathbb R$ is  neighborhood for any real point.
- Any finite (with finite number of elements) is not a neighborhood for any real point
- $\forall x, v > 0:$
	- $\;]x - v, x + v[\;$ is a neighborhood for all its points
	- $[x - v, x + v]$ is a neighborhood for all its points but $(x - v)$ and $(x + v)$
