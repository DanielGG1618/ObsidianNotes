## Definition
- Let $f: D\to\mathbb R$ be a function, $d\in D$ be a point such that $f$ is defined in some [[Neighborhood of real points|neighborhood]] of $d$.
- If there exists the limit $\displaystyle\lim_{\Delta\to0}\frac{f(d+\Delta)-f(d)}{\Delta}$ in reals, then it is denoted as $f'(d)$, is called derivative of $f$ at point $d$
- function $f$ is said to be differentiable at point $d$ in this case
## One-side Definitions
$\displaystyle f'_{+0}(d)=\lim_{\Delta\to0+0}\frac{f(d+\Delta)-f(d)}{\Delta}$

$\displaystyle f'_{-0}(d)=\lim_{\Delta\to0-0}\frac{f(d+\Delta)-f(d)}{\Delta}$
