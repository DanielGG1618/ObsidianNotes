## Definitions
- *Equivalence* is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive relation ([[Binary Relation]])
- *Equality* is the equivalence that satisfies Leibnitz axiom: $$\forall \phi:x = y \iff \phi(x) \Leftrightarrow \phi(y)$$
## Note
- Congruent triangles are not actually equal because of existence of location property.
