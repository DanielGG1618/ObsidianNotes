## Existences:
- The empty set exists
- Enumerable sets exist
- Infinite sets exist
- Maps (functions from a set to a set) exist
- Power-sets (the seta of all subsets of a set) exist
- Subsets specified by properties exist
- Unions of sets
- [[Cartesian Product]]s of sets exist
## Ways of formulating
- Relationships such as "to be an element" ($\in$), "not to be an element" ($\notin$), "to be a proper subset" ($\subset$), "to be a subset" ($\subseteq$), "equality of elements and sets" (=) can be used
## Definitions
- There is the empty set $\emptyset: A\notin \emptyset$ for every set of $A$
- For any finite collection of sets of $A_1, ..., A_n$ there is a set {$A_1, ..., A_n$} which elements are exactly $A_1, ...,A_n$.
- $\forall$ sets of $A$ and $B,\;B\subseteq A \iff \forall C\,(C \in B \implies C \in A)$  
- $A = B \iff A\subseteq B\;\&\;B\subseteq A$
