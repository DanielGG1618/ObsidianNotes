## Definition 
A function $f:D\to\mathbb R$ is said to be differentiable on a set of points $E\subseteq D$, if $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]] at each point of $E$
## Notation
- Let $D\subseteq\mathbb R$ be a set of points
- Let us denote by $C^1(D)$ the set of all functions $f: D\to\mathbb R$ differentiable at each point of $D$
- In case $D$ being an interval $[a,b],[a,b[,\;or\;]a,b[$ for some real $a\leq b$, then $C^1(D)$ is denoted as $C^1[a,b],\;C^1[a,b[,\;C^1]a,b],\;and\;]a,b[$ respectively
