## Definition
- Function $F: D \to R$ is a binary relation $F\subseteq D \times R$ such that $\forall x \in D$ exists at most one $y\in \mathbb{R}: (x, y)\in F$ 
## Definitions
- $D$ is called *Domain* of $F$
- $R$ is called *Range* (or *Co-domain*) of $F$
---
- *Domain* of a function can generally be thought of as "_what **x** can be_".
- *Range* (or *Co-domain*) of a function can generally be thought of as "*what **y** can be*".
- *Support* of $F$ is the set: $\{x\in D: F$ is defined on $x\}$
- *Image* of $F$ is the set: $\{F(x): x \in D\}$ 
---
- *Injection* (one-to-one): support $\leq$ image
- *Surjection* (onto): support $\geq$ image
- *Bijective* (one-to-one & onto): support $=$ image

##### $F: D \to R$ is a function
- $F$ is *Total* is support $=$ domain
- $F$ is *Surjective* if the range $=$ image
- $F$ in *Injective* if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the domain and the image
- $F$ is *Bijective* if it is total, surjective, and injective
