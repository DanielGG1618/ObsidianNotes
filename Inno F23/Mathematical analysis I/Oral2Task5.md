## Task
- An open set of reals is any set that contains a neighborhood of each of its points. 
- A closed set is the set-theoretic complement in $\mathbb R$ of an open set. 
- Draw (sketch) on the real axis the following sets 
1. $|x + 2| < M$
2. $|2x âˆ’ M| \geq 3$ 
3. $1 \leq |x - M| < M$. 
Which of them are open, close, or are neither open nor closed? Prove your answer.
