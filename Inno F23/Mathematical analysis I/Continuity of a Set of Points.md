## Definition
a function $f: D\to\mathbb R$ is a function
	$f$ is said to me continuous on set of points $E\subseteq D$ if $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]] at each point of $E$
	The domain of continuity of $f$ is the set of all points $E\subseteq D$ where $f$ is continuous.
## Notation
Let $D\subseteq\mathbb R$ be a set of points; let us denote by $C(D)$ the set of all functions $f D\to\mathbb R$ [[Continuity|continuous]] at each point of $D$
- In case $D$ is an interval, $C(D)$ can be denoted as $C[a,b],C]a,b],C[a,b[,C]a,b[$
