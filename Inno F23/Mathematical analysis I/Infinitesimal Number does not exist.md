## Theorem
- There is no $\alpha$ such that $\forall n \in\mathbb N: 0 < \alpha < \frac{1}{n}$ 
## Proof
- Assume existing of such $\alpha$
- $0 < \alpha < \frac{1}{n} \implies \alpha n < 1 \implies n < \frac{1}{\alpha}$ 
- $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ is a real number that is greater that *any* $n \in\mathbb N$, which [[Contradiction in Formal Logic|contradicts]] to [[All Reals are Ceiled by Naturals]] $\implies \alpha$ does not exist by  $Q.E.D. \blacksquare$
