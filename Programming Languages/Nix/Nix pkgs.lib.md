## Access
- the `nixpkgs` repository contains an [[Nix Attribute Set|attribute set]] called `lib`, which provides a large number of useful functions. They are implemented in the [[Nix]] language, as opposed to [[Nix builtints]], which are part of the language itself
## Note 
- The Nixpkgs manual lists allÂ [Nixpkgs library functions](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-functions-library).
