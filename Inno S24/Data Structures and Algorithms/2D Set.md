## Definition
- Set of 2D points that have 2 independent properties $x_1, x_2$
## Definitions
- Let us consider a region $G$ on the 2D set. Point $X_0$ of region $G$ we define as *an internal point* if $$\exists\varepsilon\in\mathbb R_+:\forall X\in G: \rho(X_0, X)<\varepsilon$$
- The region that contains only internal points in called *an open region* or *an open set*. 
- Points of the region which are not internal points are called *border points*
