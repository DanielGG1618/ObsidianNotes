- (1) Will code generative AI reduce the demand for skilled backend developers?
- (2) Which programming skills will be less important for backend developers in 5 years? 

- (Final) Which programming skills will become less essential for software developers due to the rise of AI code generation, and how will this impact the future of work for software developers?
  
  Currently, there's limited research on the **specific impact** of code generative AI on the **skillsets** needed by backend developers. While the general influence of AI on various industries is being explored, the nuanced effects on specific roles like backend developers haven't been deeply investigated.
