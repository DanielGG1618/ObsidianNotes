## Definitions
- A [[Function]] which has a [[Limit of a Function of Two Variables|limit]] is all points of given set in [[Continuity|continuous]] on the given set.
---
- Define the [[Function]] $f(x_1, x_2)$ as *continuous* in the point $Y$ if there exists the double limit $f(X)$ as $||X-Y||\to 0$
$$\lim_{||X-Y||\to0}f(Y)=f(x_1,x_2)=A$$
