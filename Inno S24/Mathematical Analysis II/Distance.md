## Definition
- For distance between two points $X$ and $Y$ we will use the form: $$\rho(X,Y)\equiv||X-Y||$$
- Without specification the kind of the norm. Mostly due to the equivalence of the norms we will assume the [[Euclidean Distance|Euclidean Norm]]
## Main Properties
- $\rho(A,B)=0\iff A=B$
- $\rho(A,B)\geq0$
- $\rho(A,B)+\rho(B,C)\geq\rho(A,C)$
