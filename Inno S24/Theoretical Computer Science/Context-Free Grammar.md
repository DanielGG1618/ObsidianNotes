## Definition 
- A context-free grammar is a formal [[Generative Grammar|grammar]] $<V_N,V_T,P,S>$ such that all the production rules in $P$ are the following forms: $$A\to\beta$$
- where $A\in V_N,\beta\in(V_T\cup V_N)^*$ 
## Fact
- Context-Free Grammars = Non-deterministic [[Pushdown Automaton (PDA)]]
